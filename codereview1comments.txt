You did a great job with the documentation of this project: you talked about both what and why, as requested. The code itself is at this point a little thin, but I see the basic gist of what you're doing and how it will fit into the larger project. Your single function is, at this point, mostly filled with filler code, so it's hard to help out and give you direction on how that might proceed. One thing I'll emphasize about your project: you're using multiple APIs to accomplish what you're doing, and this can get complicated. So test early and test often to be sure you're getting the results you want.
