# Comments
Good, thorough comments throughout the code that give a sense of not just what individual pieces are doing but why. I also appreciate that you sourced your data right in the comments.

# Code Quality
You did really well to design the code in functions: this will be useful if you ever decide to expand the program, since you can use those functions and simply add more/change return values etc.

As far as the experience of actually running the program, the design of the bulb was good and the overall execution was solid. You might consider reorienting your thinking a bit and making this an animation that projects out into the future, giving a visual representation of the year alongside the bulb.

# Ambition
This is where this project really shines. In both concept and execution, you did an excellent job and wrote about it intelligently in your README. Great work, something to be proud of.
